| [Internship Report - White Matter Tracking](https://github.com/catherinealeal/WhiteMatterTracking) | Describing 3 projects I worked on in Summer 2023 at the Pestilli Lab. Two projects cover building deep learning models for automatic white matter segmentation. The third project uses Tableau to create dashboards for usage statistics of the BrainLife.io platform. | matplotlib, seaborn | Tableau, image data, CNNs | 
| [Bread Basket Association Rule Mining](https://github.com/catherinealeal/BreadBasketAssociationAnalysis) | Using an association analysis to identify frequent item sets in transactions at a British bakery and proposing an actionable business insight. | pandas, matplotlib, mlxtend | one hot encoding, apriori method, association rules |

## Classification
| Project | Description | Libraries | Area | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| [Predicting Tumor Malignancy](https://github.com/catherinealeal/TumorMalignancy) |  Using 2 machine learning algorithms to classify tumor types as malignant or benign, and comparing the performance of the two models trained directly on the data's attributes and trained on principal components. | pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn | Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Principal Component Analysis | 
| [Fraud Detection via Ensemble Methods](https://github.com/catherinealeal/EnsembleMethodsFraudDetection/tree/main) | Explore ensemble methods AdaBoost and Random Forests to detect fraudulent transactions. | sklearn.ensemble, sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.metrics | AdaBoost, Random Forests, ROC curves | 
| [Decision Tree Classifier Predicting Home Type](https://github.com/catherinealeal/DecisionTreeClassifier/tree/main) | Create a decision tree using two impurities measures to predict the type of home. | sklearn, graphviz | decision trees, entropy, gini index | 
| [KNN Predicting Home Type](https://github.com/catherinealeal/HouseTypeKNN/tree/main) | Use the k-nearest neighbors algorithm to predict the housing type of homes in Melbourne. | pandas, numpy, matplotlib | k-nearest neighbors, accuracy |
| [Predicting Home Type with Naive Bayes](https://github.com/catherinealeal/HouseTypeNaiveBayes) | Use Naive Bayes to predict the house type of homes in Melbourne and compare the results of our classifier to skikit-learn's Naive Bayes classifier. | time, sklearn.naive_bayes | imputation, Naive Bayes |

## Regression 
| Project | Description | Libraries | Area | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| [Melbourne Homes Linear Regression](https://github.com/catherinealeal/MelbourneHomesLinearRegression/tree/main) | Creating a linear regression model to predict the prices of homes in Melbourne. | pandas, numpy, matplotlib | feature engineering, one hot encoding, linear regression | 

## Clustering 
| Project | Description | Libraries | Area | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| [Basic K-Means Implementation](https://github.com/catherinealeal/BasicKMeans) | Write functions to implement the basic k-means algorithm and apply those to a test dataset. | pandas, numpy, matplotlib | basic k-means clustering |
| [DBSCAN Clustering](https://github.com/catherinealeal/DBSCAN) | Implement the DBSCAN algorithm via function generation and compares the results to sklearn's DBSCAN implementation. Also compare the results of the DBSCAN clustering to the clustering via sklearn's K-Means function. | sklearn.cluster | KMeans, DBSCAN |
| [Hierarchical Clustering with Election Data](https://github.com/catherinealeal/ElectionHierarchicalClustering) | Use hierarchical clustering to group states based on votes cast in past elections. | scipy, sklearn | hierarchical clustering, CPCC, k-means, silhouette coefficients |
